Chapter 3: Creating Your First Spring Boot Application

Now that your environment is ready, let’s build your very first Spring Boot application. This chapter will guide you through the steps of creating a simple RESTful web application using Spring Boot.

3.1 What You Will Build

You will create a basic web application that exposes a REST API endpoint. When accessed, this endpoint will return a welcome message.

3.2 Creating the Project

Use Spring Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project.

Steps:
1. Visit https://start.spring.io
2. Choose:
   - Project: Maven
   - Language: Java
   - Spring Boot: Latest Stable Version
3. Fill in the following:
   - Group: com.example
   - Artifact: hello
   - Name: hello
   - Description: Demo project for Spring Boot
4. Add dependencies:
   - Spring Web
5. Click "Generate", download the zip file, and extract it.
6. Open the project in your IDE.

3.3 Understanding the Project Structure

Once you open the project, you will see the following structure:

src/
 └── main/
     ├── java/
     │   └── com.example.hello/
     │       └── HelloApplication.java
     └── resources/
         ├── application.properties
         └── static/

- HelloApplication.java: The main class that starts the Spring Boot application.
- application.properties: Used for configuration.
- static/: Place static web resources like HTML, CSS, JS here.

3.4 Writing Your First Controller

Create a new Java class inside `com.example.hello` package:

HelloController.java:
```java
package com.example.hello;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- `@RestController`: Marks the class as a REST controller.
- `@GetMapping("/hello")`: Maps HTTP GET requests to the `sayHello()` method.

3.5 Running the Application

Run the application from your IDE or terminal.

Using terminal:
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You should see:
```
Tomcat started on port(s): 8080
Started HelloApplication in X.XXX seconds
```

Visit http://localhost:8080/hello in your browser or Postman, and you’ll see:
```
Hello, Spring Boot!
```

3.6 Summary

In this chapter, you created your first Spring Boot application. You learned how to:
- Generate a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr
- Create a REST controller
- Run the application and access it via browser

In the next chapter, we’ll dive into core Spring Boot concepts like Dependency Injection and Configuration.
